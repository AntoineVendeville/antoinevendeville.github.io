I am a Post-doctoral researcher at the [MÃ©dialab Sciences Po](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en/) in Paris. I work on the [AI-Political Machinies](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/activites/ai-political-machine/) project under the supervision of [Pedro Ramaciotti Morales](https://pedroramaciotti.github.io/).

My research is devoted to the study of opinion dynamics in online social platforms. I wish to bridge the gap between theoretical models and empirical observations. I am also particularly interested in the impact of recommender systems, and policies related to the regulation of online social platforms from a practical perspective. Other areas of interest include voting systems, online democracy, and evolution of species. 

I am a member of the [Complex Systems Society](https://cssociety.org/home). I received the [yrCSS Bridge Grant](http://yrcss.cssociety.org/bridge-grants/), that fosters collaborations between young researchers.

Previously, I was a PhD student in the Computer Science department of University College London. I was part of the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Cybersecurity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-research/centre-doctoral-training-cybersecurity). My research project was supervised by [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io/) and [Shi Zhou](https://wp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/shizhou/).

%%% I am passionate about researching complex sociological and biological systems, with my primary focus being on human behaviour. My PhD thesis is devoted to the development of opinion dynamics and information diffusion models to quantify and control the echo chamber effect in social networks. Additionally, I have a strong interest in understanding
