I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department of University College London. I am part of the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Cybersecurity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-research/centre-doctoral-training-cybersecurity). My project is supervised by [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io/) and [Shi Zhou](https://wp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/shizhou/).

I am passionate about researching complex sociological and biological systems, with my primary focus being on humand behaviour. My PhD thesis is devoted to the development of opinion dynamics and information diffusion models to quantify and control the echo chamber effect in social networks. Additionally, I have a strong interest in understanding policies related to regulating online social platforms from a practical perspective. Other areas of focus include voting systems, online democracy, and evolution of species.
