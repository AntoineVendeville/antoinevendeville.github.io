I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department of University College London. I am part of the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Cybersecurity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-research/centre-doctoral-training-cybersecurity). My project is supervised by [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io/) and [Shi Zhou](https://wp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/shizhou/).

My research research interest the study of complex sociological and biological systems. My PhD thesis is devoted to the development of opinion dynamics and information diffusion models to quantify and control the echo chamber effect in social networks. On a more practical level, the regulation of online social platforms is a topic of major interest to me.
