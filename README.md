# About me

I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department of University College London. My project is supervised by [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io/) and [Shi Zhou](https://wp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/shizhou/).

I am part of the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Cybersecurity](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/study/postgraduate-research/centre-doctoral-training-cybersecurity)
		
My research is about trying to understand the emergence of polarisation and echo chambers in social networks. What are the characteristics of dynamical opinion processes that foster these phenomenons, and can they be controlled?
